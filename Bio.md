# Hello everyone!
## My name is Alice Horton and I want to share a couple of things about myself.

### I am a 28 year old artist who was born in San Francisco California. I grew up in Los Angeles where I did my elementry and high school schooling. Then moved to the east coast which I now live at in  Manhattan New York with my Dobermann named Max where I attended Columbia University. I now work for a cosmetic company as a 9 to 5 but on my spare time Im building my platform on youtube.

### I am very into minimalism and aesthetic art. I paint whenever I have the chance and I usually go for a modern bohemian vibe.  Below are links to some of my favorite minimalist youtubers that inspire me.
