# Music!
## Music is a big part of my life!
I love music, specifically
### My favorite music genres are:
 + Theatre
 + Pop
 + Country
## Theater
Theater is by far my favorite genre of music of all time. It just takes you to that musical that its from and makes you feel as if you are in the play yourself.

###Hamilton
Hamilton is a musical.
## Pop
Pop is a genre that can never really be forgotten about. It had such a big impact on me from my childhood to my teenage years. Pop is such a great upbeat genre to listen when you want to get yourself out of the slumps.

## Country
Country is a genre I never listened to until recently. Country is such an emotional filled yet light hearted.
