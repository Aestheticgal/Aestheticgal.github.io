# Music!
## Music is a big part of my life!
I love music, specifically
### My favorite music genres are:
 + Theatre
 + Pop
 + Country
## Theater
Theater is by far my favorite genre of music of all time. It just takes you to that musical that its from and makes you feel as if you are in the play yourself.

### Hamilton
Hamilton is a well know musical and it is fair to say it has some of the best songs in musical history. 

## Pop
Pop is a genre that can never really be forgotten about. It had such a big impact on me from my childhood to my teenage years. Pop is such a great upbeat genre to listen when you want to get yourself out of the slumps.

### Ariana Grande 
Ariana Grande is a icon well know in the pop music industry. She has won well over 40 awards in her music career. To me she represents pop so well and is my definition of a pop star. 

## Country
Country is a genre I never listened to until recently. Country is such an emotional filled yet light hearted. Its something I listen to daily because there are just so many different types of country music such as pop country etc.

### Carrie Underwood
Carrie Underwood was the first country artist I heard. Not only is she really an amazing country singer she is also one of the most amazing country singers that are out there.
